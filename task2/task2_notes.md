# Task 2 Notes
class 0 - normal person
class 1 - irregular arrhythmia
class 2 - more irregular arrhythmia ?????
class 3 - all other types of arrhythmia

- penalize harder errors in small dataset
- data given as datapoints -> extract heartbeats
- MANUAL FEATURE EXTRACTION ???
- Alternative auto encoder
- !! Use biosppy.signals.ecg to extract heartbeats not manual?
- assume dataset is clean (check moodle)
- they use micro-avg. f1-score
